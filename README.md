## üîß Code Explanation

### Key Features:
- **PWM Speed Control**: Uses 8-bit PWM (0-255) for smooth speed control via enable pins
- **Bluetooth Communication**: Uses Dabble library for wireless gamepad control
- **Four-Wheel Drive**: Controls 4 motors (2 per side) for enhanced traction
- **Tank-Style Steering**: Implements differential drive for precise turning
- **Gamepad Interface**: Responds to directional commands from smartphone

### Motor Control Logic:
The code uses a differential drive system where motors on each side work together:

```cpp
// Forward: Both motor groups rotate forward
if (GamePad.isUpPressed()) {
    rightMotorSpeed = MAX_MOTOR_SPEED;  // 255 - Right motors (Motor1 & Motor2)
    leftMotorSpeed = MAX_MOTOR_SPEED;   // 255 - Left motors (Motor1 & Motor2)
}

// Backward: Both motor groups rotate backward  
if (GamePad.isDownPressed()) {
    rightMotorSpeed = -MAX_MOTOR_SPEED; // -255 - Right motors reverse
    leftMotorSpeed = -MAX_MOTOR_SPEED;  // -255 - Left motors reverse
}

// Left Turn: Right motors forward, left motors backward (tank steering)
if (GamePad.isLeftPressed()) {
    rightMotorSpeed = MAX_MOTOR_SPEED;  // 255 - Right side forward
    leftMotorSpeed = -MAX_MOTOR_SPEED;  // -255 - Left side backward
}

// Right Turn: Left motors forward, right motors backward (tank steering)
if (GamePad.isRightPressed()) {
    rightMotorSpeed = -MAX_MOTOR_SPEED; // -255 - Right side backward
    leftMotorSpeed = MAX_MOTOR_SPEED;   // 255 - Left side forward
}
```

### PWM Speed Control Implementation:
```cpp
// PWM configuration for smooth speed control
const int PWMFreq = 1000; /* 1 KHz frequency */
const int PWMResolution = 8; /* 8-bit resolution (0-255) */
const int rightMotorPWMSpeedChannel = 4; /* Channel 4 for right motors */
const int leftMotorPWMSpeedChannel = 5;  /* Channel 5 for left motors */

// Apply speed control via PWM
ledcWrite(rightMotorPWMSpeedChannel, abs(rightMotorSpeed));
ledcWrite(leftMotorPWMSpeedChannel, abs(leftMotorSpeed));
```

## ‚ö° Assembly Instructions

### Step 1: Component Testing (MANDATORY)
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Test each component individually before assembly to prevent damage!**

   ‚úÖ Connect each motor directly to power supply (within voltage limits 6-12V)
   ‚úÖ Verify smooth rotation in both directions
   ‚úÖ Check for any mechanical binding or unusual noises
   ‚úÖ Test current consumption (should be <2A per motor)
   ‚úÖ Ensure all 4 motors have similar performance characteristics
   ```
